# Buddy-English_Flashcards
The app contains  flashcards with English words or phrases that users can learn from. When users click on a card, it flips, revealing the Russian translation. This helps users understand the meaning of the word or phrase. Cards that users have memorized and wish to
review later can be swiped to the right.
This helps users filter words they need to revisit. The app allows users to track their progress in learning words and phrases. They can see how many 
cards they've learned, how many are remaining, and their overall progress.

(in the future it is planned) Categorization of Cards: Cards can be organized into different categories or topics so that users can learn specific words or phrases relevant to their interests or needs.
